          Working at **Cognizant Softvision** have brought me the chance to do the shift towards cloud technologies and DevOps tools, such as **AWS** and **Terraform**.

          The project day to day tasks required development and maintenance of data pipelines that were meant to ingest and process data from **relational databases**, **streaming data** sources and flat files into an enterprise datalake. _Lambda, Glue, DynamoDB, DAX, Kinesis Firehose, CodePipeline_ were the bread and butter, while the CI/CD infrastructure was managed with Terraform.
          
          Worked in close contact with the infrastructure team, by spotting bugs and suggesting new features to existing code base. Developed and maintained code according to domain best practices (Unit tests, SemVer, SOLID).
          
          Apart from the development tasks, I have supported the operational team in their tasks, by debugging and tuning **PySpark** intensive data processing jobs on top of **Palantir Foundry**.
          
          Along with this, I have worked on developing a Django internal web app.
          
          On the organisational side, I have **conducted interviews** and assessed candidates for the Big data team.
